RAKE Deploy
===========

== Description

Simple RAKE tasks to manage code, data and files on a remote server over ssh.

Run any rake task on the remote server.

Made to scratch my own itch.

== Installation ==



== Assumptions ==

Your using RubyOnRails
You login in to the server with a ssh key
Your using git, passenger and MySQL
Your on POSIX operating system (tested on Ubuntu/Mac)

== Getting Started ==

Create deploy.yml in 'config' folder with server_environment settings (see example)
rake server:setup
rake server:deploy
rake server:code:pull
rake server:database:backup

NB: It would be wise to set 'pretend' to true and see what commands will be executed before running this on a live server

== Todo ==

Add a symlinked shared folder of non-versioned files (eg. user uploads)

== Alternatives ==

If you need multi-server deploys such as separate web, app & database servers you will need to use something like Vlad or Capistrano. However staging/development versions of sites don't usually have this requirement.
