Git by Proxy
============

== Description

Simple rake tasks to rope in a graphic designer who doesn't want to use version control and (S)FTP's stuff up to the server instead (eg. file in the public and views folders). Includes multi environment deployment. But is intended to be used for collaborating on the staging version of a website. 
It also adds a copy of all existing rake tasks to the 'server' namespace with the exception that they are run on the server instead of locally.
This allows us to quickly deploy and bootstrap our application. For example "rake server:db:create" will create the database on the server.

Made to scratch my own itch.

== Installation ==

From RAILS_ROOT: git clone git://github.com/krisleech/Git-By-Proxy.git vendor/plugins/git_by_proxy

== Assumptions ==

Your using RubyOnRails
You login in to the server with a ssh key
Your using git and mod_rails
Your on POSIX operating system (tested on Ubuntu/Mac)

== Getting Started ==

Create deploy.yml in 'config' folder with server_environment settings (see example)
rake server:setup
rake server:deploy 

NB: It would be wise to set 'pretend' to true and see what commands will be executed before running this on a live server

== Other tasks/examples ==

rake server:setup RAILS_ENV=production
rake server:deploy RAILS_ENV=production
rake server:get_ui 
rake server:restart_app (assumes passenger)
rake server:update_code

== Todo ==

Can this be done better, please fork/suggest...
Better name/description
Extract more in to deploy.yml for configurability
Add a symlinked shared folder of non-versioned files (eg. user uploads)
Add cleanup task to remove old 'backups'
Is there a way to automatically run 'server_environment' dependancy...
Add logging on client and server side

== Alternatives ==

If you need multi-server deploys such as separate web, app & database servers you will need to use something like Vlad or Capistrano. However staging/development versions of sites don't usually have this requirement.
